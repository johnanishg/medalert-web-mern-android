# Multiple Medication Timings Feature

This document describes the enhanced multiple medication timings feature implemented in the MedAlert Android app.

## Overview

The multiple timings feature allows medications to have multiple scheduled times throughout the day, with proper alarm notifications and UI display for each timing. This ensures patients don't miss any of their medication doses.

## Key Features

### 1. Multiple Timing Support
- **Unlimited Timings**: Medications can have 1-4+ timings per day
- **Custom Times**: Support for custom time formats (HH:MM)
- **Predefined Timings**: Quick selection for morning, afternoon, evening, night
- **Timing Labels**: Each timing can have descriptive labels

### 2. Enhanced Alarm System
- **Individual Alarms**: Each timing gets its own alarm notification
- **Timing Context**: Alarms show which timing (1 of 3, 2 of 4, etc.)
- **Multiple Timing Info**: Alarms display all timings for context
- **Smart Validation**: Only triggers alarms for actual medication times

### 3. Improved UI Components
- **Timing Count Display**: Shows "X times/day" for each medication
- **Numbered Timings**: Each timing is numbered (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Progress Indicators**: Shows daily progress through timings
- **Current Time Highlighting**: Highlights the current timing

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Medicine with 2 Timings
```kotlin
Medication(
    name = "Paracetamol",
    dosage = "500mg",
    timing = listOf("08:00", "20:00"),
    frequency = "Twice daily"
)
```

**Result**:
- 2 separate alarms at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM
- Notifications show "Timing 1 of 2" and "Timing 2 of 2"
- UI displays "2 times/day"

### Example 2: Medicine with 3 Timings
```kotlin
Medication(
    name = "Amoxicillin",
    dosage = "250mg",
    timing = listOf("08:00", "14:00", "20:00"),
    frequency = "Three times daily"
)
```

**Result**:
- 3 separate alarms at 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 8:00 PM
- Notifications show timing context
- UI displays numbered timing chips

### Example 3: Medicine with 4 Timings
```kotlin
Medication(
    name = "Vitamin D",
    dosage = "1000 IU",
    timing = listOf("06:00", "12:00", "18:00", "22:00"),
    frequency = "Four times daily"
)
```

**Result**:
- 4 separate alarms throughout the day
- Progress tracking shows completion status
- Enhanced UI with timing indicators

## Notification Examples

Time: 08:00
```

### Alarm Notification
```
Title: ðŸ”” Morning - Paracetamol (1 of 2)
Content: Time to take Paracetamol (500mg)

Timing: 1 of 2
